        <h1>Easy Homemade Pasta</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Why buy the boxed stuff when you can make noodles at home? This homemade pasta recipe is way better than what you can buy at the store — and it’s surprisingly easy to throw together with just five ingredients you likely already have on hand!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour: This homemade pasta recipe starts with two cups of all-purpose flour. </li>
            <li>Eggs: Eggs lend fat and moisture to the pasta dough. </li>
            <li>Oil: Two tablespoons of olive oil add moisture and help the dough come together. </li>
            <li>Salt: A teaspoon of salt takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
            <li>Water: Add just enough water to form a smooth, thick dough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough. </li>
            <li>Turn the dough out and knead it for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Let the dough rest. </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into balls.</li>
            <li>Use a pasta machine to roll and cut the dough into desired shapes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Cook Homemade Pasta</h2>
        <p>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil, add the uncooked pasta, and stir. Cook until the pasta is al dente (until it has a slight bite). </p>
